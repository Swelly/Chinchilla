Before building you must set $GOPATH to be the path to the directory you are trying to compile from
to build run 
go build src/chinchilla/routers/scheduler.go
go build src/chinchilla/routers/worker.go



then to run scheduler (front end) ./scheduler <port> <port2>
then to run worker (front end) ./scheduler <ip:port> <id>
id can be anything

to request use ip:port/api/<int>/<string>

the bulk of our code can be found in

src/chinchilla/routers/scheduler.go
src/chinchilla/routers/worker.go
src/chinchilla/mssg/mssg.go

We have implemented most of the communication infrastructure.
We need to change some of it slightly to ensure it is thread safe
and robust, but we will be doing that this weekend
We will then build a load generator and start writing our load balancing
algorithm. The biggest infrastructure part we still need to build
is redundancy if a node goes down so we don't lose the entire queue.
